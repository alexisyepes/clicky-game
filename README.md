 # The Incredibles Clicky-Game

 This is a memory game created with React. 
 The application renders different images of The Incredibles Super Heroes to the screen. Each image listens for click events that re-order them to random positions. 

 ## Game's Logic

 The player earns points that increment the score trying not to click an image already clicked. If an image already clicked is clicked again, the game is over and the highest score is stored and displayed so the player can try to beat that score later on. If the player clicks all 12 images without repeating, it wins.
